INTRODUCTION
------------
Setlist-FM-dl is a simple program that utilizes the setlist.fm API to download various data.
It downloads .xml data by utilizing libcurl, libssl and libxml. It also does .xml-to-.html
transformations via libxslt. This program is a simple example of an implementation on MorphOS
of cURL/SSL as well as the useage of libxml and libxslt. This program has implemented all of
the useful (and relevant) search functions/options that are exposed in the setlist.fm public API.

Main Features:

* Downloads user concert data from Setlist.fm
* Saves output file in "ram:" in '.csv' format
* Does various searches via the open setlist.fm API
* Converts downloaded .xml data into .html via libxslt for future use and manipulation

INSTALLATION
------------
Just place the 'Setlist-FM-dl' program and 'xml' folder (the xsl stylesheets) folder wherever
you'd like on your harddrive...


USAGE
-----
- Enter a User Name and press the Download button...to get that user's concert history
...or search via the various Search items (requires setlist.fm user account and API key...)

- Have a look at the 'hot help' bubbles to get an idea of the basic program usage...

- To use the Search and '.xml to .html' conversions you must have a setlist.fm account:
https://www.setlist.fm/signup (it's totally free to have an account...)

- Once you have a user account you must apply for an API key (free) and enter it in the Prefs:
https://www.setlist.fm/settings/api

- You can state the reason for API key request as "to utilize the Setlist-FM-dl program"...

- You can use '%20' where spaces are needed, an example search: The%20Who or... Pink%20Floyd

- You can see how many pages were returned for your search in the main window at the top
of the .xml code and adjust your page number search as necessary.  The API will only return
20-30 items for each search request (depending on the request).  This is a limit of the API!

- xsl stylesheets can be edited to manipulate the .html output of the various searches (be
careful if you're not sure what your doing...as the output formatting is easy to break!)

- Internationalization: This preference is used for localizing cities, countries, etc.  The
default language is English (en), but you can provide any of the following languages: Spanish (es),
French (fr), German (de), Portuguese (pt), Turkish (tr), Italian (it) or Polish (pl) codes.
Just enter the two letter language code in the Prefs settings...

RECOMPILING
-----------
Stable build with MorphOS SDK 3.12 and gcc 2.95.3

Major dependencies: libcurl, libssl, libxml2, libxslt

Compile: gcc -o Setlist-FM-dl setlistfmdl.c -lcurl -lssl -lcrypto -ldl -lpthread
-lxml2 -lxslt -lz -liconv -lm -s -Wall
******************
Current build with MorphOS SDK 3.16 and gcc 9 (noixemul)

TO DO
-----
- error checking...program does not do any error checking, but when started from the
command line you can see what is happening with your cURL requests and, however,
it also gives feedback of the server response in the main window...

- Other ideas to implement?  I'm listening...
